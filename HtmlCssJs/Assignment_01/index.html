            <p>Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. 
                Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). 
                Lastly, make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title 
                region. (Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 
                19.
            </p>

            <p>
                Section title region: Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at 
                the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the titles 
                from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (Hint: use 
                relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22

            <p>Before we upload our code to GitHub we first need to make GitHub Desktop aware of our 
                project files. We do this by creating a new Repository folder, then copy our website files to 
                this new folder.
                3.2 — When the “Create a New Repository” dialog window appears, fill in the “Name” text input as:
